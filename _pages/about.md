**Chuanfu Chen obtained both his Master’s and Ph.D. degrees from Lomonosov Moscow State University (MSU)**, the top-ranked university in Russia, consistently listed among the global top 100 in QS rankings, and home to 13 Nobel laureates.

Focusing on the theme of **“Microwave–Ionosphere Cross-Medium Transmission”**, Chuanfu Chen has continuously carried out research and gradually developed a systematic analytical and theoretical framework that covers **ionospheric dynamic characterization, precise ionospheric parameter measurement, and evaluation of microwave signal propagation effects through the ionosphere**. His main research achievements are as follows:

## 1. **Developing mechanisms and methods for characterizing complex ionospheric dynamics**:

Addressing the multi-scale temporal and spatial variability of ionospheric structures, Chen overcame the limitation of relying solely on local Total Electron Content (TEC) as a single metric. Building upon the **Global Electron Content (GEC)** concept—**first systematically introduced and applied by Chen and his advisor Padokhin’s Russian team** (e.g., Astafyeva et al., 2008)—he incorporated its derived parameters (latitudinal/longitudinal gradients, scintillation/irregularity indices, etc.) and established a **global assessment framework with a unified quantitative scale**. This framework systematically characterizes ionospheric evolution across multiple typical time scales: revealing **27-day solar rotation** and **annual/semiannual periodic components**, as well as quantifying the response of the global electron distribution to **geomagnetic storms and other strong disturbances**. **The work theoretically advanced empirical representations of ionospheric global dynamics, providing operational methodologies for space environment monitoring and space weather forecasting.**

### 2. **Creating precise measurement methods for single-frequency ionospheric evolution parameters**:

To address accuracy bottlenecks in ionospheric monitoring and navigation applications using single-frequency receivers, **Chen and his Russian team were the first to propose and validate an innovative method for retrieving vertical TEC based on single-frequency Alternative Binary Offset Carrier (AltBOC) signals**. Leveraging the wideband spectral characteristics and strong multipath resistance of AltBOC signals, they **systematically analyzed its potential for precise TEC measurement, improving single-frequency navigation receiver accuracy in determining ionospheric electron density by an order of magnitude**. This achievement was **featured by the Russian science media outlet Scientific Russia**.

### 3. **Proposing unified evaluation metrics and computational criteria for ionosphere–microwave interactions**:

To address the long-standing challenge of lacking a standardized framework for assessing different ionospheric models, Chen and his Russian team proposed and established a **unified evaluation system covering nine major global ionospheric models**, constructing a system of model-independent metrics. This framework enables cross-domain comparisons and rapid assessments of the Klobuchar model, Galileo’s NeQuickG model, BeiDou’s BDGIM model, the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) series, and the Global Empirical TEC (GEMTEC) model, all under a consistent coordinate and evaluation standard. **The outcome provides a practical and comparable standardized tool for GNSS systems worldwide to model and correct ionospheric errors.**

## Abstract

For decades, GNSS code measurements were much noisier than phase ones, limiting their applicability to ionospheric total electron content (TEC) studies. Ultra-wideband AltBOC signals changed the situation. This study revisits the Galileo E5 and BeiDou B2 AltBOC signals and their potential applications in TEC estimation. We found that TEC noises are comparable for the single-frequency AltBOC phase-code combination and those of the dual-frequency legacy BPSK/QPSK phase combination, while single-frequency BPSK/QPSK TEC noises are much higher. A two-week high-rate measurement campaign at the ACRG receiver revealed a mean 100 sec TEC RMS (used as the noise proxy) of 0.26 TECU, 0.15 TECU, and 0.09 TECU for the BeiDou B2(a+b) AltBOC signal and satellite elevations 0–30°, 30–60°, and 60–90°, correspondingly, and 0.22 TECU, 0.14 TECU, and 0.09 TECU for the legacy B1/B3 dual-frequency phase combination. The Galileo E5(a+b) AltBOC signal corresponding values were 0.25 TECU, 0.14 TECU, and 0.09 TECU; for the legacy signals’ phase combination, the values were 0.19 TECU, 0.13 TECU, and 0.08 TECU. The AltBOC (for both BeiDou and Galileo) SNR exceeds those of BPSK/QPSK by 7.5 dB-Hz in undisturbed conditions. Radio frequency interference (the 28 August 2022 and 9 May 2024 Solar Radio Burst events in our study) decreased the AltBOC SNR 5 dB-Hz more against QPSK SNR, but, due to the higher initial SNR, the threshold for the loss of the lock was never broken. Today, we have enough BeiDou and Galileo satellites that transmit AltBOC signals for a reliable single-frequency *vTEC* estimation. This study provides new insights and evidence for using Galileo and BeiDou AltBOC signals in high-precision ionospheric monitoring.

**Sep. 2021 — Jun. 2022: Teaching Assistant**
*Lomonosov Moscow State University, Faculty of Physics*

During this period, I worked as a teaching assistant for the course **“Fundamentals of Physics in Environmental Remote Sensing.”** My responsibilities included supporting the lecturer in course delivery, preparing instructional materials, and assisting students in understanding the physical principles underlying remote sensing technologies.

I also helped guide discussions on the application of physics to environmental monitoring, covering topics such as electromagnetic wave propagation, radiative transfer, and the interpretation of remote sensing data. Additionally, I supervised practical assignments, provided feedback on coursework, and offered academic support to students to strengthen both their theoretical understanding and practical skills.

This experience allowed me to deepen my knowledge in applied physics and environmental studies, while also gaining valuable experience in teaching interdisciplinary subjects that connect physics with real-world environmental applications.

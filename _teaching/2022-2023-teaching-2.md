**Sep. 2022 — Jun. 2023: Lecturer**
*Lomonosov Moscow State University, Faculty of Physics*

During this period, I worked as a lecturer at the Faculty of Physics, Lomonosov Moscow State University. My main responsibility was teaching the undergraduate laboratory course **“Mechanics Experiments.”** This course provided students with hands-on training in classical mechanics, including experimental design, data collection, and error analysis. I guided students through fundamental experiments such as motion analysis, oscillations, conservation laws, and dynamics of rigid bodies.

In addition to delivering lectures and supervising lab sessions, I also prepared teaching materials, evaluated reports, and provided individual feedback to help students strengthen both their experimental and analytical skills. This role allowed me to further develop my teaching methodology, improve my ability to explain complex physical concepts clearly, and gain valuable experience in mentoring undergraduate students in a laboratory environment.
